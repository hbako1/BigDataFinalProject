# BigDataFinalProject
This project is an analysis of a dataset  consisting of trending video on youtube.
It contains statistics about youtube videos that are trending in countries such as the US, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany, India,
Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Russia. 
For the purpose of this video we mainly focused on the first six countries. 
This datasets are divided into different csv files that are 50 mb each for a total of about 500 mb.
You will also need json files for each country dataset to add the name of the categories for each country dataset.
You can download them on the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
Each dataset has about 40 000 rows and 16 catgories. 
We only used the first 11 categories for this study.
We used Spyder IDE through anaconda for the preprocessing.
We used Jupyter Notebook for the data analysis.
To start:
1. Download the csv files for the US, Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany and India with the associated json category file.
2. Make sure you move all these file to the directory associated with the python IDE files because the path isn't included in our program.
3. Then you can download our the zip project that contains this files, our spyder program, and our jupyter notebook.
4. At the end, our program generates new csv files with the cleanse dataset, but the path is customed made for one of our computer.
   So you will need to change it, to generate the files in one of your prefered folder. Do not change the name of the files though
   because it might affect the steps in Jupyter notebook. If you do, please do not forget to change them in our jupyter notebook progam too.
   Then, you can run the program and see what the program does.
5. To check the content of the dataframesin Python, you have to go to the variable explorer and click on the variable name
   to see the content because Spyder doesn't have a a specific tool to access the dataframe content. 
6. From there on, you can play with the program and see what we did to clean the data.
7. After that, you will notice that new csv files will be generated in your chosen folder. 
8. You can upload these files to your jupiter notebook space.
9. You can then, upload our program to your jupyter notebook.
10. After that, open the notebook and press run all to check out our analysis of this dataset.
11. You can play with the program and see what each code does.
